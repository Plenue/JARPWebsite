**JARP or JEE Adv Rank Predictor**
---

JARP unlike other Rank Predictor is based on Deep Learning Model. This mean that prediction will be quite close to your actual rank. During my Jee Adv time (that's 2017), diference between Actual & Predicted Rank (Avg from different site) was more than 3000. Hence this motivated me to make rank prediction model that have higher similarity to actual rank mark distribution.
